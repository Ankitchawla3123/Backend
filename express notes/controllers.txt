// call back functions of routes that actually performs an business logic are controllers


import { aysncHandler } from "../utils/asyncHandler.js";

// use case of aysnc handler  in destructured format / raw

//  app.get('/user', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => { // that aysnc function is a controller 	
//   const user = await getUserFromDB(); // throws error
