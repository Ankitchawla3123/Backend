LEFT join opperation 
eg:- book has title, author id, genre
author id is linked to author document which has name and age 
so what will be the agg pipline

[
  {// cuurently in books 
    $lookup: {
      from:"authors" ,
      localField: "author_id",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as:"author_details"
    }
  },
  {},
  {}
 ]

lookup act as where clause to join 2 tables and give the result back of the matching author
in return we will get an array of authordetails in which 1st element would be usefull to us so we would be needed that ahead 

[
  {// cuurently in books 
    $lookup: {
      from:"authors" ,
      localField: "author_id",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as:"author_details"
    }
  },
  // stage 2 will have the object with author details array but won't be as field but we can add it as a field in stage 2 like below
// to access the first element of array we used $first from author_details($ used because author details is an array now part of the document from above pipeline
  {$addFields: {
    author_details: {
      $first: "$author_details"
    # $arrayElemAt : ["$author_details",0] return the 0th value(1st elem of array) same way 
    }
  }},
]
