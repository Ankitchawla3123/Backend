These are the tips for mongoose saved here, 
Pre hook in mongoose plays an important part here. It is middleware which can be called on various event like save load etc
Pre middleware functions are executed one after another, when each middleware calls next.
schema.pre("save" , task (async task sometimees) ) it is a middle ware so next is also passed in this, arrow function not to be used in call back as we might need the use of this  


methods in mongo db is also very popular i can define methods  while defining the scheme or i can define it later by calling
schema.methods.methodName =  function --// could be an async function also mostly is 

sooner we can call these methods whenever we needed for example userid and pass login time, etc etc
