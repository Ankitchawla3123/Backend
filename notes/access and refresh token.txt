what is access and refresh token 
access token is short lived and refresh token is long lived

so if my access token get expired instead of returing 401 error we can use refresh token to re generate acesstoken, if from cookies refresh token seems to be valid i can create new access token or else we will ask user to login again	


REFRESH TOKEN REQUEST TO BE HANDLED BY FRONT END 
ROUTE FOR THIS IS BELOW

userRouter.route("/refresh-token").post(refreshAccessToken);
// if user get a failed login/ access token expired he should hit this point if response is not success then he should login again else he would have new refresh tokens
// to be handled in front end
